Beginners Guide to Git and Workflow 

A workflow must contain the following basic components:

    One or more events that will trigger the workflow.
    One or more jobs, each of which will execute on a runner machine and run a series of one or more steps.
    Each step can either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.
